We find the services flag in services.txt and some notes that maybe will give us a hint later

There are a few directories here for various services and their config files, but the standout is in the redis config file in which the following line is commented out

```
# requirepass REDACTED
```

So we likely have a redis password now so lets try and enumerate that next.

We also checked the other keys but of interest was the internal flag and the authlist which gave us some base64 to decode and receive a rsync password from
Hcg3HP67@TW@Bc72v

This copies all the files onto our system for us to examine. We find a the username sys-internal and the user.txt flag. After unsuccessfully looking for exposed credentials to actually establish a foothold. We decide to upload our ssh-public key and ssh into the box that way

#Privilege Escalation
So in recently another room, https://tryhackme.com/room/overlayfs, describes a Ubuntu kernel exploit present on Ubuntu 18.04 servers.

```

And as simple as the at we have a root shell, I find it hard to believe this was the intended method of privilege escalation as the CVE for this exploit is fairly reason and outside the domain of services which the room has been exploring. So lets explore the services on the system and see if we can find the more intended privilege esclation method.

#Intended Privilege Escalation/TeamCity service
Ultimately after a bit of searching, if we upload linpeas it's not too hard to find, we find the TeamCity service running locally as root on port 8111 along with some possible authentication tokens in /TeamCity/logs/catalina.out. So first we put set up a port forward 

```
ssh -N -L 8111:127.0.0.1:8111 -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa sys-internal@10.10.72.124
```

once this tunnel has been set up we can connect to the service in our browser at localhost:8111 or whatever port you forwarded to and try the tokens as passwords to a blank username and see if we gain access. Sure enough one works and we have access to the console. I have never used TeamCity before so we had to some research but ultimately discover we can use it to run custom scripts on the server. To do so we do the following,
```
Create a project -> choose manually -> Create a build configuration -> choose manually -> skip VCS root -> select Build Steps(on the left sidebar) -> Add build step -> choose build runner
```

The build runner you choose here will allow you to run various types of scripts on the system such as python or command line scripts. We can just choose the build runner and the run a custom command of our choosing in the appropriate syntax. At this point there are various ways to get a root shell such as writing new superusers to /etc/passwords, giving the sys-internal user sudo privileges in /etc/sudoers, setting a sticky bit on bash to get an effective root shell, etc... ultimately choose one then save the build step and proceed to select the project and click run to execute the build and execute our build step that we configured with our custom script. Depending on what method you chose you can now go back to the system and leverage our new privilege escalation method to get a root shell and claim the root.txt flag.
